    <h1>Hustling = Freelancer.com</h1>
    <i>April 26, 2016</i><br /><br />
There is something about Freelancer.com that is HIGHLY addictive. Apart from the fact that the website is so decorated that it almost resembles a slot machine at a casino, I love the pop-up job ads that continually appear whenever you sign on to the website. What makes them especially great is that these particular ads are tailored to the settings you’ve adjusted on your Freelancer profile, so that they are—in theory—only the most relevant jobs that are available on the site for you. For example, if I call myself a “ghostwriter,” then only those jobs that require ghostwriters will pop up on my screen whenever I am logged on. And these ads pop up almost every 45 seconds.<br /><br />

I spent almost half the day on this site applying for this job and that job, and oh wow, this job too! And that job! Before I knew it, the whole day had almost past me by, and I had achieved a paltry one invitation for a job to be paid $2 USD per page of English writing! Alas, that’s not going to help me survive in Thailand. I am going to need at least 10 dollars per day to survive in Thailand, for now. Ideally, 20 USD (the other 10 is to pay for my apartment here which is presently going for 150 USD per month, the cheapest you can go). If I don’t get a job soon, through one of these job sites, I’m going to either have to become a hooker or move to poorest province of India—maybe Goa or some other area where they might have pity on my soul.<br /><br />

Freelancer.com seems the most hopeful save for the fact that there is plenty of competition and almost virtually nothing helping me to stand out from the crowd aside from my lame-ass experience which almost anyone could have achieved (and probably have at this stage of our economic evolution). I’m reminded of what Seth Godin says in his book Linchpin. In order to be wanted by someone, you have to sort of do your own remarkable thing and then the jobs will come rolling your way. It’s ironic, isn’t it? To get work, you can’t be looking for work! Taylor Pearson says the same in his book, The End of Jobs, where he goes so far as to argue that there are no more jobs, only little gigs here and there and that you might as well do the stuff that you’re passionate about now because it sure as hell won’t be any other way that you get noticed. I struggle with these thoughts to be honest because I want to follow my passions, but on the other hand, I also have to make ends meet in order for me to make it to my passions.<br /><br />

I suppose I could always go back to my sister’s house back in the states if I absolutely needed to, but I think this would be more of a disaster in the long run—better to become a prostitute. I could also maybe get some shelter from other globe trotters like myself, maybe in Sweden or Italy, but this is a long shot and assuming that they would be able to do this for me (which could be a dead-wrong assumption). Maybe I could work in a hostel, but it would have to be in another country, and I don’t want to leave Thailand. I am just getting to know it!<br /><br />

Yep, indeed, folks, we live in scary times, filled with uncertainty. Thailand is beautiful, but if I can’t make it in this inexpensive country, I surely can’t make it anywhere. I suppose this will be the ultimate test for me. And if I fail? I guess I could just crawl up in a ball and die. But hey, I’ve made it this far, and so have you, dear Reader! So whom are we kidding? We can do this, and we will!<br /><br />

Hope you’ll all follow me on this journey! Touch base soon.
